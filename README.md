# A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball
Use MLB's Statcast data to compare New York Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.

# Description
There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, you will use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

The dataset used in this project is from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about).
